[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-plugin-samsung-air-conditioner.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-plugin-samsung-air-conditioner)

Homebridge plugin for controlling Samsung Air Conditioner working on port 2878. Allows to control AC with HomeKit and Siri.
If you have Samsung AC which operates on port 8888, check this plugin instead: https://github.com/cicciovo/homebridge-samsung-airconditioner

## Installation
1. Install [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).
2. Install this plugin by running `npm install -g homebridge-plugin-samsung-air-conditioner`.
3. Assign static IP address to your AC (check your router settings to do that).
4. Run `homebridge-samsung-ac-get-token <your ac's ip address>` in terminal and follow instructions. If you get any SSL/certificate errors. Try `homebridge-samsung-ac-get-token <your ac's ip address> --skipCertificate`.
5. Update your Homebridge `config.json`. Check `config-sample.json` for reference. 
    - Required parameters:
        - `accessory` - always "Samsung Air Conditioner"
        - `name` - Name of your device
        - `ip_address` - IP address of air conditioner
        - `mac` - MAC address of air conditioner in format `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` or `AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF`
        - `token` - token returned by `homebridge-samsung-ac-get-token <your ac's ip address>`
    - Optional parameters:
        - `skip_certificate` - `true`/`false` (default `false`). If `true` then skips passing certificate to underlying connection which might mitigate SSL errors on some AC units. Try it if you get any SSL/certificate errors.
        - `log_socket_activity` - `true`/`false` (default `false`). If `true` then logs additional raw data to console
        - `keep_alive` - dictionary with keep alive settings:
            - `enabled` - `true`/`false` (default `true`). If `true` then enables keep alive on underlying socket
            - `initial_delay` - milliseconds as integer (default `10000`). Time which needs to pass after last write to socket before sending first keep alive packet
            - `interval` - milliseconds as integer (default `10000`). Time between keep alive packets
            - `probes` - integer (default `10`). Number of keep alive packets to fails before treating connection as closed
